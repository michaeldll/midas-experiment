## How to develop :
```
npm i
```
then
```
npm run watch
``` 
in one CLI

npm run serve
``` 
in another CLI.

This will serve `public/index.html` using built `built/out.js` and `built/out.css` files from `/src/index.mjs`

## How to deploy

```npm run build``` 

to minify files, then deploy the `public` folder.
